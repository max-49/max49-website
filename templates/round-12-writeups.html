          <p>In this chall, we're given the python file used to make the encoded flag as well as the encoded flag. We're also given the hint of "caesar". We know this is not a ceasar cipher because running though all the possible combination yields no plaintext. Doing some more googling shows us the vigenere cipher, an encryption method using multiple interwoven caesar ciphers based on a key. We can bruteforce a key using <a href="https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher" target="_blank">dcode</a> and we can recover the plaintext, at the end of which is the flag.</p>

          <h3>Solve:</h3>
          <p>This chall actually involves a little bit of thinking. Upon going to the website, we see the source and see that we need to get the flag somehow in /check. Based on the conditions and the format of the /check code, it seems unlikely that we would be able to bruteforce a flag. What we do see though is <span class="pre">render_template_string()</span>, which can have the Server Side Template Injection, or SSTI, vulnerabilty. In Flask, two curly braces indicate variables that can be placed into the html (ex. <span class="pre">{{ variable }}</span>). We know that from the source that the flag is located in the flag variable, so we need to find a way to get this to the /check page. First, though, I wanted to get the length of the flag, so I ran this script to know the flag was 20 chars long (The output wasn't "Bad length!" at 14 chars on the inside of the flag):</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="python">
import os
for i in range(25):
    print(f"{i+1} chars")   
    os.system("curl http://puzzler7.imaginaryctf.org:4000/check?flag=ictf\\\{" + "a"*(i+1) + "\\\}")
    print("")
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>After this, all that was left was to craft an argument that would yield the flag. This was my final URL: <a href="http://puzzler7.imaginaryctf.org:4000/check?flag=ictf{%20%20%20%20%20%20%22,flag%2B%22}" target="_blank">http://puzzler7.imaginaryctf.org:4000/check?flag=ictf{%20%20%20%20%20%20%22,flag%2B%22}</a>, which when decoded and put into the the render_template_string() gives us the flag.</p>

          <p>By inspecting the binary psuedocode, we can see that we need to overflow a buffer, but this buffer is malloc() rather than just square brackets. We need to get the value of *p1var1 (according to the pseudocode) to equal 0x13371337, so we need to carefully construct this buffer overflow in order to change this variable. So with malloc(), some metadata is inserted around the 0x40 (64) buffer (8 bytes before and after), so in total, we need 80 characters of filler before we can insert the new variable. Here was my final script (once you get shell, the flag is in flag.txt):</p>

          <p>So to solve this, I had originally downloaded an mbox viewer, but then I realized that I could just open the file like a txt file and I was file doing that. Looking at the emails, we see a bunch of "randomly" generated passwords encoded in base64. From the description, we can just look up "twister cryptography" and we see the mersenne twister. Looking up past ctf challs that involve this, we can see that there already exists a python package to predict next values given enough of a pattern. So to solve this chall using the function in the latest email and past writeups, I made this script (email.txt is the .mbox file without the first and last email):</p>
          <pre>
            <code class="python">
from base64 import b64decode
from mt19937predictor import MT19937Predictor
predictor = MT19937Predictor()
file = open('email.txt', 'r').readlines()
count = 0
passAt = 16
passwords = []
for line in file:
    count += 1
    if(count == passAt):
        passwords.append(line.strip())
        passAt += 19
for password in passwords:
    predictor.setrandbits(int.from_bytes(b64decode(password)[:4], 'big'), 32)
    predictor.setrandbits(int.from_bytes(b64decode(password)[4:], 'big'), 32)
flag = b""
for i in range(10):
    nextrand = predictor.getrandbits(32)
    flag += int.to_bytes(nextrand, 4, 'big')
print(flag.decode())

          <p>So for this chall, we get one line to try to get the flag. Looking at the spec, we see that we can use readf to read files, which is what we want to do, but there's a filter blacklisting words like "read", "flag", "txt", etc., so we can't just directly read flag.txt. In the spec, we also see exec, which executed icicle code, but we can input an int and it'll convert it using intstr. We can use the strint method to convert <span class="pre">readf r1, "flag.txt"</span> to an int and exec it, but if we input this, we don't get an output. If we add a newline in our conversions to int (ascii --> hex --> decimal) and add tpr r1, we get <span class="pre">exec 183827312370185651168152020034418275188078876928815084123222577</span> and inputting this into the server gives us the flag.</p>

The challenge for this chall, though, was reversing the output into a flag. I was able to do that through this script (get_key() is meant to retrieve the starting key by going through every possible number until that number, when ran through the middle square method, gives the bytes in the output text. The next part of the script is meant to use that starting key to go through every possible letter and test them against the output bytes to get the flag.):</p>

          <p>Running zsteg on this image gives some text, but nothing useful. Looking at this image, we see that the left side looks like water, but as the image progresses right, the water becomes more and more distorted, especially around the middle. To me, this kind of looked like a stereogram, or magic eye, so I ran it through a stereogram solver and actually recovered some text: <span class="pre">G1R12B0</span>. With the hint "LSB" from the capitalized letters in the title, we can assume we need to extract the least significant bit. I used stegonline to do this, pressing Extract Files/Data, Checking 1 and 2 above R, 1 above G, and 0 above B. I then set the bit plane order to GRB as in the stereogram text. Trying to extract it with LSB returns nothing (strange), but extracting it with MSB gives us a jpg with the flag.</p>

          <p>Just looking at the attachment, we can see that it's a bunch of regex with only one case that would match it, the flag. I used regex101 to solve this chall because I find that this website gives a bunch of useful information when trying to match regex. My method of solving this wasn't very organized and consisted mainly of trying to match one positive lookahead and then adding more onto it and consistently trying to match them. StealthyDev was very helpful in the support ticket and mainly helped just debug my flag and find out why certain cases weren't working. All in all, I found it was easier to make the flag near the end of the flag near the closing brace and then work my way to the front. Overall, great chall that taught me more about regex!</p>

          <p>For this one, we were given a Unity game. Launching this game shows us the first few character of the flag at the end of a hallway, but getting too close brings up a barrier that prevents us from reading the whole flag. To try and get the flag, I thought there were two ways  I could do it. I could either reverse the game code to change the function of the barriers or try to extract the assets and textures to get the flag. I thought the texture extraction would be easier so I attempted to do that (with many different programs), but none of them worked for some reason. I eventually gave in and decided the reverse the code and after some searching, found dnSpy, a program where I could decompile dlls into c++, edit the code, and recompile it. After finding this, I loaded <span class="pre">Assembly-CSharp.dll</span> and found the function that raises the barriers. There were multiple things you could've done at this point to stop the raising of the barriers, but I just deleted the for loop that raises them and that seemed to work fine. After I recompiled the file, I was able to launch the game and walk down the hallway to see the flag.</p>

          <h3>ICICLE Golf</h3>
          <p>You've spent so long writing this interpreter and solving other ICICLE challenges, it'd be a shame if you never actually coded in ICICLE! Write some simple programs. As a bonus, if you have the shortest program, I'll buy you nitro! See the readme for details.</p>

          <p>In this chall, we're given the task of completing three challenges by creating solutions in ICICLE. The first one was "cat", where it was tasked to mimick what happens when the "cat" command it typed without any arguments into a linux shell, the second one was "gcd", where it was tasked to take 2 numbers as input and output the gcd of them, and the third one was "sort", where it was tasked to take input for a length, ask for that many numbers, and then sort all those numbers and output them.</p>
          <p><a href="/static/iciclegolf.zip" download>Here's</a> a link to download all of my scripts</p>
          <p>For "cat", I first just tested out cat in my shell to see what it actually did and then tried to emulate that with icicle. It's kind of difficult to explain my thought process, but ICICLE is pretty easy to read, so it's not that hard to see what I was doing based on my code</p>
          <p>For "gcd", I looked up some gcd finding algorithms and came across <a href="https://people.cs.ksu.edu//~schmidt/301s14/Exercises/euclid_alg.html" target="_blank">this article</a> with a function in c to calculator the gcd of two numbers, so I tried to replicate this code, but using ICICLE to get my solve</p>
          <p>For "sort", I first was confused on how I was meant to gather variable amounts of user input, but then was reminded of storing numbers in memory rather than in registers by puzzler. After that, I decided to use insertion sort to sort the numbers and found <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-insertion-sort/" target="_blank">this website</a> with a python script to perform insertion sort. After a lot of trial and error and typos, I was able to create an ICICLE script that worked and was able to get the flag by converting all the scripts to base64 (I used CyberChef) and submitting them into the server.
